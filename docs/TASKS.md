Todo:
[] Refactor wheel builders (factories) to be more stateful
[] We should let the analyst create different cycles and evaluate probabilities for them
[] Make sure everything works when passing thesis (or multiple theses) without the context, i.e. thesis is the context and it's possible to apply dialectics purely based on semantics

Done:
