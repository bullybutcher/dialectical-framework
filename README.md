# Dialectical Framework
Turn stories, strategies, or systems into insight. Auto-generate Dialectical Wheels (DWs) from any text to reveal blind spots, surface polarities, and trace dynamic paths toward synthesis.
 DWs are semantic maps that expose tension, transformation, and coherence within a system—whether narrative, ethical, organizational, or technological.

## What It Does:
 - Converts natural language into Dialectical Wheels (DWs)
 - Highlights thesis–antithesis tensions and feedback loops
 - Reveals overlooked leverage points and systemic blind-spots
 - Maps decisions, ethics, or mindsets across dialectical structures

## Built for:
 - Systems optimization
 - Wisdom mining & decision diagnostics
 - Augmented intelligence / narrative AI
 - Ethical modeling & polarity navigation

## Useful for:
 - Consultants, coaches, facilitators, and system designers
 - Storytellers, educators, and regenerative thinkers
 - Strategists, SDD/BIMA practitioners, values-driven innovators

# Development

## Contributors Welcome!

We invite developers, philosophers, cognitive scientists, and regenerative ecosystem builders to co-create with us.

## Setup

Behind the scenes we heavily rely on [Mirascope](https://mirascope.com/)

## Environment Variables

| Variable Name          | Description                                     | Example Value    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| DEFAULT_MODEL          | Default model name for the framework            | gpt-4            |
| DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER | Model provider (required)                       | openai           |

You can store these in a `.env` file or export them in your environment.

These will specify the default "brain" for your reasoning.
